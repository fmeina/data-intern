# data-intern
Project for intership recruitment

Simple console app in python, that allows us to analyze data from .csv file, that you need to start the program

You can:
-calculate average number of people who took the exam for a given voivodeship over the years, up to and including the year
-calculate percentage of passivity for a given voivodeship over the years
-see voivodeship with best passivity in exact year
-see voivodeships, which passivity has regressed
-compare two voivodeships

Also, for every option you can choose if you want to analyze it for woman, men or everyone.
